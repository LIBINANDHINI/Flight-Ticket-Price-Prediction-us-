### EDA Process

**What is Exploratory Data Analysis in Data Science?**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the techniques used for extracting vital features and trends used by machine learning and deep learning models in Data Science. Thus, EDA has become an important milestone for anyone working in data science. This article covers the concept, meaning, tools, and techniques of EDA to give complete awareness to a beginner wanting to launch a career in data science. The article also enlists those fields that regularly apply EDA efficiently in promoting their business activities.  

**Importance of EDA in Data Science**
The Data Science field is now very important in the business world as it provides many opportunities to make vital business decisions by analyzing hugely gathered data. Understanding the data thoroughly needs its exploration from every aspect. The impactful features enable making meaningful and beneficial decisions; therefore, EDA occupies an invaluable place in Data science.

**Objective of Exploratory Data Analysis**
The overall objective of exploratory data analysis is to obtain vital insights and hence usually includes the following sub-objectives: 

- Identifying and removing data outliers
- Identifying trends in time and space
- Uncover patterns related to the target
- Creating hypotheses and testing them through experiments
- Identifying new sources of data 

**Steps Involved in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Data Collection
- Finding all Variables and Understanding Them
- Cleaning the Dataset
- Identify Correlated Variables
- Choosing the Right Statistical Methods
- Visualizing and Analyzing Results
